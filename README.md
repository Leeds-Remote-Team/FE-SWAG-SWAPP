Welcome to Swag Swapp!

This is your virtual wardrobe application where you can view all of your clothes at your fingertips.

All you need to do is take a photo of an item or clothing and this will be stored in your app - with added fashion tags thanks to Ximiliar's AI fashion tagging API!

This app was made with JavaScript, Express, postgreSQL, Ximiliar API, SupaBase, Render, TDD, React Native, Expo and NodeJS.

To view this app, please clone and enter the github repo: https://github.com/Leeds-Remote-Team/FE-SWAG-SWAPP

Now install the dependancies: "npm install"

Then use "npm run dev" to start-up the app.

Please bare in mind, this app is designed for andoid and ios.

To view on your phone, download the Expo Go app in the play/app store on your mobile device and scan the barcode in the terminal with your phone's camera.
